BaRated Final Project
=========================

What is BaRated?
-----------

BaRated is a simple bar website that includes bars from New Brunswick, 
New Jersey.  This project was done for the Advanced Web Design course at Rutgers
University for the Spring 2016 semester.  This project uses the bootstrap
framework to give the site it's layout, Javascript and jQuery for it's
front-end functionality, and ajax and php for it's backend functionality.  The 
backend database is hosted by Cloud 9.  Users are able to post ratings and
comments about the bars on the site as well as view ratings, comments, and 
information about the bars (including hours of operation, phone number, etc.).
